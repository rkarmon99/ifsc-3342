  <p>
    In 2016, Boseman was diagnosed with colon cancer. Boseman kept his condition private, continuing to pursue his acting career while receiving treatment. After a four-year battle, he died in 2020 from complications related to the illness. The world was in complete shock and fans all over the world were heartbroken . Chadwick was real superhero to me bebcause he was fighting an illness while playing in major roles. 
  </p>
  <p>Boseman is a hero because of his bravery to make a difference. He acknowledges that together, we can overcome conflict and hatred. “His portrayals of African-American heroes have shown how black America has always been able to transform pain into something powerful” (Combs). Boseman is a hero because of the way he intends to incorporate his perspective on equality and racial injustice into his acting career. It takes bravery and true courage to acknowledge such a serious topic while society is watching and judging you. Boseman takes a stand to make our world a more inclusive place for all people, no matter their ethnic background. “But it’s within the fraught dynamic between the hero and his primary adversary where 'Black Panther' deftly explores subversive and probing concerns around race, history, heritage and identity”</p>
