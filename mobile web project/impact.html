  <h2 class="display-3">How did Chadwick Boesman career played in the community??</h2>
  <p class="lead">
  <p>  Boseman played many influential Black figures throughout his career. One of them was Jackie Robinson in the 2013 film “42.”
  <p>Robinson was the first African American to play in Major League Baseball. Robinson broke the color barrier and ended racial segregation in professional sports, but his activism did not stop there. He protested for civil rights during the 1960s, advocated for social justice and racial integration and brought awareness to issues such as redlining. </p>
  <p>Boseman reintroduced younger generations to Robinson through his role in the film. It is important for Black youth and the Black community entirely to be educated on individuals who look like them that helped paved the way for them to be where they are now. Robinson was the role model for athletes to use their platform to bring awareness to social justice, just like we are seeing now in the NBA bubble, NFL and other leagues as conversations on racial justice continue to become prominent. Boseman’s talent and dedication to the role helped the Black community embrace our Black heroes.
Boseman also played a Black superhero, T’Challa, in the 2018 film “Black Panther.” What was special about Boseman bringing a Black superhero to the big screen was the uplifting and refreshing Black representation. Many major films involving Black actors and actresses have portrayed the typical “Black people are oppressed” roles, and are a constant, painful reminder of past and current history in this country.
</p>
<p>It was rejuvenating seeing Black people as victors, powerful and important in “Black Panther.” It gave the Black community a sense of dignity and pride, no matter the occupation. It gave little Black boys and girls a superhero to enjoy as a kid and look up to.
In the athletic world, many players held up the “Wakanda forever” salutes after scoring a goal, touchdown or basket. Victor Oladipo put on a T’Challa mask while Chadwick Boseman assisted him with the “Black Panther” tribute dunk during the 2018 Slam Dunk Contest. NFL player Michael Bennett hilariously yelled “Wakanda Forever” during lineup announcements ahead of NFL games. Chicago Bulls player Wendell Carter Jr. wore a “Black Panther”-inspired outfit to the 2018 NBA Draft.
</p>
<p>It gave Black athletes the confidence boost to perform at a high level for their teams. Following the news of Boseman’s passing, athletes like Lebron James and Lewis Hamilton paid tribute to Boseman with the “Wakanda Forever” salute.
Boseman’s portrayal of “Black Panther” made the Black community feel empowered to do anything. Boseman’s entire catalog was dedicated to telling important Black stories to uplift the culture in heart-wrenching times. He made it his duty, his purpose and his passion.
